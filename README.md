Sample project to test knowledge in `useState` and `useEffect`. The project asks for a user identifier and takes input from the user to store in an array. The array is then displayed as a list of to-do tasks. The user can add a task, mark tasks as done, remove a task, clear the list, or start from scratch. The project uses the browser Web Storage's `localStorage` mechanism to store the user's identifier and to-do list. When visiting the project again using the same browser, users can continue going through the list from where they left off. Check out the [live version](https://todo.norugie.me/).
